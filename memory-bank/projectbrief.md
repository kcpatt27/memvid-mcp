# MemVid MCP Project Brief

## Project Identity
**Name**: MemVid MCP Server  
**Owner**: reishi  
**Start Date**: December 2024  
**Completion Date**: December 2024 - ✅ PROJECT COMPLETE
**Status**: Production-ready NPM package (@kcpatt27/memvid-mcp-server)  

## Core Mission
Build a general-purpose Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that leverages MemVid's revolutionary video-based AI memory system to provide AI coding assistants with powerful semantic search and memory capabilities using MP4 files instead of traditional vector databases.

## Key Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **Portable Memory**: Single MP4 files contain entire knowledge bases
- **Semantic Search**: Fast, accurate search without GPU requirements (<500ms response)
- **Multi-Source Support**: Files, directories, URLs, and text content
- **Memory Management**: Create, search, update, merge, and analyze memory banks
- **IDE Integration**: Native support for Cursor, Aider, and fast-agent
- **Offline Capability**: Full functionality without internet connectivity

### Technical Requirements
- **Platform**: Node.js 18+ with TypeScript
- **Protocol**: MCP SDK 0.5.0+ compliance
- **Integration**: Python 3.8+ bridge for MemVid operations
- **Validation**: Zod schema validation for all tool arguments
- **Storage**: JSON registry with MP4 memory files
- **Performance**: Sub-second search, efficient memory usage

### Quality Requirements
- **Reliability**: Robust error handling and recovery
- **Scalability**: Support for multiple concurrent operations
- **Maintainability**: Clean TypeScript architecture with comprehensive types
- **Usability**: Intuitive tool interfaces matching developer workflows

## Project Scope

### In Scope
- Core MCP tools (create, search, add, list, context)
- Advanced operations (merge, export, analyze)
- Multi-file type support (text, markdown, PDF, code files)
- Configuration management and optimization
- IDE integration templates and documentation

### Out of Scope
- Real-time collaborative features (future extension)
- Multi-modal content (images, diagrams) - phase 2
- Git integration automation (future extension)
- Custom embedding models (use MemVid defaults)

### Constraints
- **Technology**: Must use MemVid as core memory engine
- **Performance**: Search latency must be <500ms for typical queries
- **Compatibility**: Cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- **Dependencies**: Minimize external dependencies beyond MCP SDK and MemVid
- **File Size**: Support memory banks up to 100MB per MP4 file

## Timeline & Phases

### Phase 1: Core Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
**Goal**: Basic MCP server with essential memory operations
- MCP server framework setup
- MemVid integration bridge
- Core tools: create_memory_bank, search_memory, list_memory_banks
- Basic error handling and logging
- Configuration management

### Phase 2: Enhanced Operations (Week 3)
**Goal**: Full memory management capabilities
- Add tools: add_to_memory, get_context
- Metadata and tagging system
- Memory bank registry persistence
- Multi-file type support
- Search relevance improvements

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Week 4)
**Goal**: Production-ready feature set
- Multi-bank operations (merge_memory_banks)
- Export/import capabilities
- Analysis and statistics tools
- Performance optimization and caching
- Advanced configuration options

### Phase 4: Integration & Polish (Week 5)
**Goal**: Ready for production use
- IDE configuration templates
- Session management features
- Real-time memory updates
- Comprehensive testing suite
- Documentation and usage examples

## Success Criteria

### MVP (End of Phase 2) ✅ COMPLETE

- [x] Memory bank management (create, search, list, context)
- [x] Working MCP integration for all compatible AI tools
- [x] Comprehensive error handling and recovery
- [x] Performance optimization with caching

### NPM Package Distribution ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] NPX installation: `npx @kcpatt27/memvid-mcp-server`
- [x] Auto-configuration for zero-setup experience
- [x] Cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- [x] Professional documentation and user guides
- [x] Organized repository structure with comprehensive testing

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **MemVid Integration Complexity**: Python-Node.js bridge may have performance/stability issues
  - *Mitigation*: Early prototype and testing, fallback to direct CLI calls
- **MCP Protocol Changes**: SDK updates may break compatibility
  - *Mitigation*: Pin SDK versions, test against multiple IDE clients

### Medium Risk
- **Performance at Scale**: Large memory banks may cause latency issues
  - *Mitigation*: Implement caching, lazy loading, and optimization strategies
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Python environment setup varies by OS
  - *Mitigation*: Provide platform-specific setup scripts and documentation

### Low Risk
- **File Type Support**: Some formats may not work well with MemVid
  - *Mitigation*: Start with core formats, extend based on testing results
