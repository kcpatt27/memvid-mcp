# Product Context - MemVid MCP

## Problem Statement

### Current Pain Points
**Knowledge Fragmentation**: Developers constantly lose context when switching between projects, IDEs, or working sessions. Critical information gets scattered across documentation, code comments, Stack Overflow searches, and mental notes that disappear over time.

**Context Loss**: AI coding assistants start fresh every session, requiring developers to repeatedly explain project structure, patterns, and domain knowledge. This creates friction and reduces productivity.

**Infrastructure Complexity**: Traditional vector databases require complex setup, ongoing maintenance, GPU resources, and cloud dependencies. This creates barriers for individual developers and small teams who want persistent AI memory.

**Portability Issues**: Knowledge bases are often tied to specific platforms, making it difficult to share context between tools, team members, or development environments.

## Solution Vision

### Core Innovation
MemVid MCP transforms the way AI assistants access and maintain persistent memory by using **MP4 files as portable knowledge containers**. Instead of complex vector databases, developers can create, share, and manage AI memory using simple video files that work anywhere.

### How It Works
1. **Capture**: Convert any content (code, docs, conversations) into searchable MP4 memory files
2. **Search**: AI assistants query these memory files for relevant context in real-time
3. **Evolve**: Memory banks grow organically as new information is added during development
4. **Share**: Memory files are portable and can be shared like any other file

## User Experience Goals

### For Individual Developers
- **Instant Context**: Start any coding session with full project context immediately available
- **Zero Setup**: No database configuration, GPU requirements, or cloud dependencies
- **Persistent Memory**: AI assistant remembers patterns, decisions, and project knowledge across sessions
- **Universal Access**: Same memory works across different IDEs and AI tools

### For AI Assistants (Cursor, Aider, etc.)
- **Rich Context**: Access to project history, coding patterns, and domain knowledge
- **Fast Retrieval**: Sub-500ms response time for context queries
- **Semantic Understanding**: Find relevant information even with different terminology
- **Continuous Learning**: Memory improves automatically as developers work

### For Teams
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Easily share project context through portable memory files
- **Onboarding**: New team members get instant access to project knowledge
- **Consistency**: Shared understanding of patterns, conventions, and decisions

## Core Workflows

### Workflow 1: Project Memory Creation
```
Developer starts new project
↓
Runs: create_memory_bank("project_context", sources: ["./src", "./docs"])
↓
MemVid processes files into searchable MP4 memory
↓
AI assistant has instant access to full project context
```

### Workflow 2: Context-Aware Development
```
Developer opens AI assistant
↓
AI queries: search_memory("authentication patterns")
↓
Receives relevant code examples and documentation
↓
AI provides context-aware suggestions and code generation
```

### Workflow 3: Knowledge Evolution
```
Developer implements new feature
↓
Adds to memory: add_to_memory("project_context", "New OAuth implementation...")
↓
Memory bank grows with new patterns and knowledge
↓
Future queries include this new information
```

### Workflow 4: Cross-Session Persistence
```
Developer ends coding session
↓
Memory bank automatically saves state
↓
Next session: AI immediately has access to all previous context
↓
No need to re-explain project structure or patterns
```
