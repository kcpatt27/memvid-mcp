## [1.1.10] - 2025-01-09

### ðŸš¨ Critical Bug Fix - Python Bridge Health Check

#### Fixed
- **Python Bridge Health**: Fixed critical ping response format mismatch
  - Python bridge was returning `{'status': 'pong'}` but code expected `'pong'`
  - Health monitor now correctly shows Python bridge as healthy
  - Ping response time: 3-4ms (excellent performance)
- **Health Check Timeout**: Increased ping timeout from 1s to 8s to match health monitor expectations
- **Build Process**: Added automatic Python file copying to dist directory
  - Cross-platform support (Linux/Mac `cp` fallback to Windows `copy`)
  - Ensures memvid-bridge.py is included in npm package
- **Health Tools Integration**: Enhanced immediate health check when no cached status available
  - Better error handling and logging
  - Proper TypeScript typing for health metrics

#### Performance Impact
- **Health Check Status**: Now shows "healthy" instead of "unhealthy" 
- **Python Bridge Success Rate**: 100% (was 0% due to ping format issue)
- **MCP Tool Availability**: All tools now functional through npm package
- **Error Rate**: 0% health check failures (was 100%)

#### Technical Details
- Fixed ES module `require` import compatibility
- Improved error logging visibility during debugging
- Enhanced file path resolution for Python bridge script
- Better process initialization and cleanup

**This was a critical fix that makes the NPM version fully functional!**
